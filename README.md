# exam-exercises

This is a repo to store my solutions for the higher level IT matura exams while practicing. 

All solutions are written in C++, and mainly use these libraries:
* algorithm
* vector
* string
* iostream
* fstream
* sstream
* stdio
* stdlib
* time

Disclaimer:
*These solutions do not need to be the most optimal ones - they just need to work. So don't expect elegant solutions.*
